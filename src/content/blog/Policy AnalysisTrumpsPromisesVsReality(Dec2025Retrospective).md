## 1. The Economy: "Lowering Prices" vs. "Tariff-Driven Inflation"

| Aspect              | Promise (2024 Campaign)                                  | Action (2025 Implementation)                                                      | Reality & Negatives (Outcomes)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| **Inflation/Costs** | End inflation; immediately lower grocery and gas prices. | Implemented a **10-20% universal tariff** and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.      | **Tariffs increased costs** for American families, estimated by the [PIIE Analysis](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2024/trumps-bigger-tariff-proposals-would-cost-typical-american-household-over) to be **~$2,600 per year** per household. |     |
| **Taxes & Debt**    | Massive tax cuts; fiscal responsibility.                 | Signed legislation extending 2017 tax cuts and eliminating federal taxes on tips. | **Deficit Exploded:** Projections by the [Penn Wharton Budget Model](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024) estimated these policies would add **$5.8 trillion** to the national deficit.         |     |
| **Energy**          | "Drill, Baby, Drill" to ensure cheap energy.             | Issued executive orders removing restrictions on oil and gas leasing.             | Despite high domestic production, gas prices remained subject to **volatile global markets**, contradicting the promise of low, stable prices.                                                                                                          |     |

## 2. Foreign Policy: "Peacemaker" vs. "Stalled Conflict"

| Aspect | Promise (2024 Campaign) | Action (2025 Implementation) | Reality & Negatives (Outcomes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ukraine War** | End the war "in 24 hours." | Restricted US aid to Ukraine; administration walked back the 24-hour claim. | **Stalled Progress:** The war continued through 2025. The administration's rhetoric was later characterized as non-literal or "sarcasm." [Source: AP News](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-633a216d0506c82353fc7745b69c0fe0) |
| **Alliances** | Transactional approach to NATO; America First. | Continued to demand full payment from NATO allies. | Created **diplomatic friction** and prompted key European allies to form independent security pacts, suggesting a decline in US global influence. |

## 3. Immigration and Labor: "Sealing the Border" vs. "Economic Disruption"

| Aspect | Promise (2024 Campaign) | Action (2025 Implementation) | Reality & Negatives (Outcomes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Border Enforcement** | Launch largest domestic deportation operation; seal the border. | Reinstated "Remain in Mexico"; initiated large-scale workplace raids. | **Labor Shortages:** Deportation efforts severely disrupted key industries, with the [Baker Institute](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/social-and-economic-effects-expanded-deportation-measures) warning of a resulting decline in GDP and labor shortages in construction and agriculture. |
| **Housing** | Deportations would free up housing. | Workplace raids caused labor shortages in construction. | Industry reports indicated that the loss of construction workers led to **project delays and cost overruns**, worsening the housing supply crisis.

## 4. Governance & Healthcare: "Drain the Swamp" vs. "Unfulfilled Promises"

| Aspect | Promise (2024 Campaign) | Action (2025 Implementation) | Reality & Negatives (Outcomes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Civil Service** | "Demolish the deep state"; fire "rogue bureaucrats." | Reissued an executive order reclassifying civil service workers as "at-will" employees (Schedule Policy/Career). | **Agency Instability:** The measure led to a **"brain drain"** as non-partisan, experienced personnel were replaced by political appointees, slowing government functions. |
| **Healthcare** | Repeal Obamacare and replace it with a cheaper, better plan. | Allowed enhanced ACA subsidies to expire; no comprehensive replacement plan was introduced. | **Promise Stalled:** Millions of Americans faced higher insurance premiums due to expiring subsidies. The lack of a plan was consistent with Trump’s own prior admission that he only had **"concepts of a plan."** [Source: ABC News/Debate Transcript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p6zZZ3DPGE) |

Progress on major campaign promises, such as ending the war in Ukraine and replacing the ACA, was effectively **stalled or abandoned**.
