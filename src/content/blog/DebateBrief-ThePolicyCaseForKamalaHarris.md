# Debate Brief: The Policy Case for Kamala Harris

---

## 1. The Economy: "The Opportunity Economy" vs. "Inflationary Tariffs"
**The Argument:** Harris focused on lowering specific family bills (housing, child care, groceries). Trump focused on universal tariffs (effectively a sales tax) and corporate tax cuts.

* **Inflation & Costs:**
    * **Trump:** Proposed a 10-20% universal tariff on imports. The **Peterson Institute (PIIE)** estimated this would cost the average household **$2,600/year** in higher prices.
    * **Harris:** Proposed a federal ban on price gouging and a **$6,000 Child Tax Credit** for families with newborns to offset cost-of-living spikes.

* **Small Business:**
    * **Harris:** Proposed raising the tax deduction for startup costs from $5,000 to **$50,000**, effectively making the first year of business tax-free for entrepreneurs.

* **The Deficit:**
    * **Comparison:** The **Penn Wharton Budget Model** estimated Trump’s plan would increase the deficit by **$5.8 trillion** over 10 years, compared to **$1.2 trillion** for Harris.

## 2. Healthcare: "Capping Costs" vs. "Repeal"
**The Argument:** Harris had a legislative track record of lowering drug prices; Trump ran on "concepts of a plan" to repeal the ACA (Obamacare) without a guaranteed replacement.

* **Prescription Drugs:**
    * **Harris:** Cast the tie-breaking vote for the *Inflation Reduction Act*, which capped insulin at **$35/month** and out-of-pocket drug costs at **$2,000/year** for seniors. She proposed extending this cap to *all* Americans.

* **Reproductive Rights:**
    * **Comparison:** Harris supported federal legislation to codify *Roe v. Wade*. Trump appointed the justices who overturned it, resulting in state bans that threaten IVF and emergency care.

## 3. Immigration: "Border Solutions" vs. "Mass Deportation"
**The Argument:** Harris supported the toughest bipartisan border bill in decades; Trump killed it to keep the issue alive.

* **The Bipartisan Bill:**
    * **Harris:** Supported the **Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations Act**, which would have funded thousands of new border agents and asylum officers.
    * **Trump:** Lobbied Republicans to vote against the bill in early 2024 to prevent a legislative win for the administration.

* **Economic Impact:**
    * **Trump:** Proposed mass deportations. Economists warned this would devastate the agriculture and construction sectors, causing food and housing prices to skyrocket due to labor shortages.

## 4. Housing: "Supply & Assistance" vs. "Deregulation"
**The Argument:** Harris had a specific plan to fix the supply shortage; Trump relied on deregulation.

* **Down Payment Assistance:**
    * **Harris:** Proposed providing **$25,000** in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers who have paid rent on time for two years.
* **Building Supply:**
    * **Harris:** Proposed tax incentives for builders to construct **3 million new housing units** specifically for the starter-home market.

## 5. Foreign Policy: "Global Stability" vs. "Isolationism"
**The Argument:** Harris’s policy strengthened alliances that benefit the US economy; Trump’s tariffs and NATO skepticism invited instability.

* **Trade & Alliances:**
    * **Harris:** Supported targeted restrictions (e.g., semiconductors to China) while maintaining trade stability with allies (EU, NATO).
    * **Trump:** Proposed a universal tariff that would hit allies like the UK and Canada, risking trade wars that hurt American farmers and exporters.
* **Global Security:**
    * **Harris:** Committed to NATO and Ukraine aid to degrade Russian military power without risking US troops.
    * **Trump:** Frequently questioned the value of NATO and suggested he would encourage Russia to do "whatever the hell they want" to members who don't pay enough.
